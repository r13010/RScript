1.host linux prep - install scream

yay -S scream

2.guest windows 10 prep - install scream

go to: https://github.com/duncanthrax/scream
and restart
oh and make sure you dont have secureboot on

3.start scream from linux host

use:
scream -i virbr0

where 'virbr0' is the virtual interface the kvm uses
DONT configure anything in the windows 10 guest (in regedit) for scream,
this will make scream to work under multicast mode on port samsungunidex/4010

optionally (maybe not optionally) check the firewall to allow both internet on the interface and
to scream to function on that port, because it may be blocking it if its not working

in firewalld (if you use it as your firewall) go and select virbr0 and change its zone as trusted,
leave yours as home, etc
